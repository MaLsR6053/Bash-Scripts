# Bash-Scripts

<h2>This is a place for all of my bash scripts as I learn more about how they are created and used to improve efficiency for your workflows.</h2>
<b>1. The ctf_directory_creater script will take user input for the name of the machine you are working on, and create a directory under your /home/CTF/ directory along with the associated sub_directories of: Nmap, Exploits, and Extras.</b>


<b>2. The network_troubleshooter will walk you through a basic troubleshooting process to help you diagnose network issues.</b>

<b>3. The file_rename script will allow you to rename any file in your system easily.</b>

<b>4. And finally, the update script will perform a standard update, full-upgrade, and autoclean and autoremove functions.</b>
